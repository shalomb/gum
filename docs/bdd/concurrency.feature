# Concurrency and Data Integrity Feature

## Background
Given gum is installed with the unified database system
And the database contains projects and project directories
And the system is configured for concurrent operations

## Scenario: Multiple jobs of the same action running simultaneously
Given multiple gum processes are running concurrently
When I run "gum projects --refresh" in multiple terminals simultaneously
Then all processes should complete successfully
And the database should remain consistent
And no data corruption should occur
And the final project count should be consistent across all processes

## Scenario: Different jobs updating the database at the same time
Given gum projects and gum sync are running concurrently
When I run "gum projects --refresh" and "gum sync" simultaneously
Then both processes should complete successfully
And the database should maintain referential integrity
And no foreign key constraint violations should occur
And the cache should remain consistent

## Scenario: Mixed read/write operations under concurrent load
Given multiple gum processes are performing different operations
When I run mixed operations (read, write, refresh) concurrently
Then all operations should complete successfully
And the database should maintain ACID properties
And no race conditions should occur
And the system should maintain performance

## Scenario: Long-running operations with integrity monitoring
Given gum processes are running for extended periods
When I run long-running operations (2+ minutes) concurrently
Then the system should maintain stability
And database integrity should be preserved
And no memory leaks should occur
And performance should remain consistent

## Scenario: Cache consistency under concurrent access
Given multiple processes are accessing the cache simultaneously
When I run "gum projects-v2" multiple times concurrently
Then all processes should return consistent results
And the cache should maintain coherency
And no stale data should be returned
And the cache hit rate should be optimal

## Scenario: Database integrity verification after concurrent operations
Given concurrent operations have been running
When I run "gum integrity" after the operations complete
Then the integrity check should pass
And no orphaned records should be detected
And no duplicate records should be found
And foreign key constraints should be satisfied

## Scenario: Error recovery under concurrent load
Given the system is under heavy concurrent load
When errors occur during operations
Then the system should recover gracefully
And no data should be lost
And the database should remain consistent
And subsequent operations should work normally

## Scenario: Performance under concurrent load
Given multiple processes are running simultaneously
When I measure system performance
Then response times should remain under 100ms
And memory usage should be stable
And CPU usage should be reasonable
And the system should handle the load gracefully

## Scenario: Transaction isolation under concurrent operations
Given multiple processes are performing database operations
When transactions are running concurrently
Then each transaction should see a consistent view
And no dirty reads should occur
And no phantom reads should occur
And the isolation level should be maintained

## Scenario: Lock contention and deadlock prevention
Given multiple processes are accessing the same data
When lock contention occurs
Then the system should handle it gracefully
And no deadlocks should occur
And operations should complete eventually
And the system should remain responsive

## Scenario: Concurrent cache invalidation
Given multiple processes are updating cached data
When cache invalidation occurs concurrently
Then the cache should remain consistent
And no stale data should be served
And the invalidation should be atomic
And subsequent reads should get fresh data

## Scenario: System recovery after concurrent failures
Given the system has experienced concurrent failures
When I restart the system
Then the database should be in a consistent state
And no data should be lost
And the system should start normally
And all functionality should be restored

## Scenario: Monitoring and alerting under concurrent load
Given the system is under concurrent load
When I monitor system metrics
Then I should be able to track performance
And I should be able to detect issues
And I should be able to verify integrity
And I should be able to ensure reliability
