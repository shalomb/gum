# Performance and Scalability Feature

## Background
Given gum is installed and configured
And the user has a large number of Git repositories

## Scenario: Handle large project collections efficiently
Given the user has 1000+ Git repositories across multiple directories
When I run "gum projects"
Then the command should complete within 5 seconds
And all projects should be discovered
And memory usage should be reasonable (< 100MB)

## Scenario: Cache performance with large datasets
Given 1000+ projects have been discovered and cached
When I run "gum projects" again
Then the results should be returned within 1 second
And the cache should be used effectively
And no re-scanning should occur

## Scenario: Database performance with many projects
Given 1000+ projects are stored in the database
When I run "gum projects --search api"
Then the search should complete within 2 seconds
And results should be returned quickly
And database queries should be optimized

## Scenario: Parallel directory scanning
Given multiple directories contain Git repositories
When I run "gum projects --refresh"
Then directories should be scanned in parallel
And the total scan time should be less than sequential scanning
And all repositories should be discovered

## Scenario: Incremental updates
Given projects have been cached
And only a few new repositories have been added
When I run "gum projects --refresh"
Then only changed directories should be re-scanned
And the update should be faster than a full scan
And new repositories should be discovered

## Scenario: Memory efficiency with large result sets
Given 1000+ projects exist
When I run "gum projects --format json"
Then memory usage should remain stable
And the JSON should be streamed efficiently
And no memory leaks should occur

## Scenario: Handle deep directory structures
Given repositories exist in deeply nested directories (10+ levels)
When I run "gum projects"
Then all repositories should be discovered
And scanning should be efficient
And no infinite loops should occur

## Scenario: Database connection management
Given gum is used frequently
When I run multiple "gum projects" commands
Then database connections should be reused efficiently
And no connection leaks should occur
And performance should remain consistent

## Scenario: Cache TTL performance
Given projects have been cached with TTL
And the TTL has expired
When I run "gum projects"
Then the cache should be invalidated automatically
And projects should be re-discovered
And the new cache should be created efficiently

## Scenario: Handle slow filesystems
Given projects are located on a slow network filesystem
When I run "gum projects"
Then gum should handle the slow access gracefully
And provide progress feedback if possible
And not timeout prematurely

## Scenario: Concurrent access handling
Given multiple gum processes are running simultaneously
When I run "gum projects" from multiple terminals
Then all processes should work correctly
And database locks should be handled properly
And no corruption should occur

## Scenario: Large configuration files
Given a configuration file contains 100+ directory entries
When I run "gum projects"
Then the configuration should be parsed efficiently
And all directories should be processed
And performance should remain good

## Scenario: Search performance with many projects
Given 1000+ projects exist
When I run "gum projects --search common-term"
Then the search should complete within 2 seconds
And results should be ranked by relevance
And the search should be case-insensitive

## Scenario: Similarity calculation performance
Given 1000+ projects exist
When I run "gum projects --similar query"
Then similarity calculations should be cached
And results should be returned within 3 seconds
And the cache should improve subsequent queries

## Scenario: Database size management
Given gum has been used for months with many projects
When I check the database size
Then it should remain reasonable (< 50MB)
And old entries should be cleaned up automatically
And performance should not degrade

## Scenario: Handle filesystem errors gracefully
Given some directories have permission errors
And other directories are accessible
When I run "gum projects"
Then accessible directories should be scanned
And errors should be logged but not crash the program
And performance should not be significantly impacted

## Scenario: Memory usage under load
Given gum is used continuously for an hour
When I monitor memory usage
Then memory usage should remain stable
And no memory leaks should occur
And garbage collection should work properly

## Scenario: Startup performance
Given gum is run for the first time
When I run "gum projects"
Then startup should be fast (< 2 seconds)
And initial database creation should be efficient
And configuration should be loaded quickly

## Scenario: Handle interrupted operations
Given a long-running "gum projects --refresh" is interrupted
When I run "gum projects" again
Then the operation should start cleanly
And no corrupted state should remain
And performance should be normal

## Scenario: Database optimization
Given the database has been used extensively
When I run "gum projects"
Then database queries should be optimized
And indexes should be used effectively
And query plans should be efficient

## Scenario: Cache invalidation performance
Given a large cache exists
When I run "gum dirs-cache --clear"
Then the cache should be cleared quickly (< 1 second)
And subsequent operations should work normally
And no performance degradation should occur

## Scenario: Handle network timeouts
Given some project directories are on network filesystems
And network timeouts occur
When I run "gum projects"
Then gum should handle timeouts gracefully
And continue with accessible directories
And provide appropriate error messages

## Scenario: Resource cleanup
Given gum has been used extensively
When I check system resources
Then file handles should be properly closed
And database connections should be cleaned up
And temporary files should be removed

## Scenario: Scalability with multiple users
Given multiple users are using gum on the same system
When each user runs "gum projects"
Then each user should have isolated caches
And database access should be properly managed
And performance should not degrade for any user

## Scenario: Handle disk space constraints
Given the cache directory has limited space
When I run "gum projects"
Then gum should handle space constraints gracefully
And clean up old cache entries if needed
And continue to function with reduced cache

## Scenario: Performance monitoring
Given gum is running
When I monitor system performance
Then CPU usage should be reasonable during operations
And I/O operations should be efficient
And network usage should be minimal

## Scenario: Benchmark consistency
Given the same set of projects
When I run "gum projects" multiple times
Then performance should be consistent
And results should be identical
And timing should be predictable
